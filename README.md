# textExtraction

simple text extraction from image url using js.
make sure your image url have the file extenstion ( such as .png .jpg etc )
sometimes it recognize letters / numbers as ] or # for some reason if the image is not in good quality ( so probably better to upload a good resolution image where you see all the text you want to get from the image )
